# Customer Segmentation Project

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **clustering techniques** to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and demographics.  
By identifying patterns in customer data, businesses can develop **targeted marketing strategies** and improve customer relationship management.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding customer patterns
- Optimal cluster selection using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**
- Implementation of clustering algorithms:
  - KMeans
  - Mini-Batch KMeans
  - Hierarchical Clustering with Dendrograms
- Visualization of customer segments
- Attaching cluster labels to the dataset for further business analysis

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy  

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and standardized the dataset  
2. **EDA**: Explored key variables influencing customer behavior  
3. **Clustering**: Applied KMeans, Mini-Batch KMeans, and Hierarchical clustering  
4. **Evaluation**: Determined the best number of clusters using metrics  
5. **Results**: Segmented customers into groups like high-value, budget shoppers, and frequent buyers  

## 🎯 Business Value
- Helps businesses personalize marketing campaigns  
- Improves customer retention and loyalty programs  
- Provides insights for product recommendations and strategic decisions
